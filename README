This is a fork of gnome-raw-thumbnailer from Gnome's git.

Note: there are two projects in existence with the same name.

1. The one from Sourceforge: http://gnome-raw-thumb.sourceforge.net/
   This is the one Ubuntu packages. It is based on the old dcraw.c code 
   and was last updated in 2005. Doesn't support orintations and is
   terribly slow with thumbnail sizes over 160 pixels (exif embedded thumbnail).
   
2. The one in Gnome git: http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/RawThumbnailer/
   This one is very simple, as it delegates everything to libopenraw.
   It supports orientations, is much faster, but fails with 256px thumbnails.
   
This fork fixes the issue with Gnome's thumbnailer, so it is fast and works
nicely with Ubuntu 13.10. Hopefully the changes from here can be pushed upstream
and Ubuntu will adopt this working version soon.
